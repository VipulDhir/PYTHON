# Dictionary and sets aren't sequence types
# i.e. we cant access the items using indexing
# dictionary stores key values pars 
# Python dict = Java hash Map

# Sets are unorders collection of things
# it is very difficult to retrieve items from sets
# .items() in dictionary is equal to enumerate in lists
